#### Tyk OAS APIs Compatibility Caveats {#TykOAS-v5.3.0}

This upgrade transitions Tyk OAS APIs out of [Early Access]({{< ref "frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features" >}}). 

- **Out of Early access**
  - This means that from now on, all Tyk OAS APIs will be backwards compatible and in case of a downgrade from 5.3.X to 5.3.0, the Tyk OAS API definitions will always work.
- **Not Backwards Compatible**
  - Tyk OAS APIs in Tyk Dashboard v5.3.0 are not [backwards compatible](https://tinyurl.com/3xy966xn). This means that the new Tyk OAS API format used by Tyk Gateway/Dashboard v5.3.X does not work with older versions of Tyk Gateway/Dashboard, i.e. you cannot export these API definitions from a v5.3.X Tyk Dashboard and import to an earlier version.
  - The upgrade of Tyk OAS API definitions is **not reversible**, i.e. you cannot use version 5.3.X Tyk OAS API definitions with an older version of Tyk Dashboard.
  - This means that if you wish to downgrade or revert to your previous version of Tyk, you will need to restore these API definitions from a backup. Please go to the [backup]({{< ref "#upgrade-instructions" >}}) section for detailed instructions on backup before upgrading to v5.3.0.
  - If you are not using Tyk OAS APIs, Tyk will maintain backward compatibility standards.
- **Not Forward Compatible**
  - Tyk OAS API Definitions prior to v5.3.0 are not [forward compatible](https://tinyurl.com/t3zz88ep) with Tyk Gateway v5.3.X.
  - This means that any Tyk OAS APIs created in any previous release (4.1.0-5.2.x) cannot work with the new Tyk Dashboard v5.3.X without being migrated to its [latest format]({{<ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc">}}).
- **MDCB deployment and Tyk OAS APIs**
  - Tyk OAS APIs created in Tyk v5.3.0 will not be loaded by the data plane gateways if you are using MDCB v2.4 or older. This means that MDCB users already working with Tyk OAS APIs **must wait for the release of MDCB v2.5** before upgrading Tyk Gateway and Dashboard to v5.3.0. 
  - Tyk Dashboard v5.3.0 managing Tyk OAS APIs requires Tyk Gateway v5.3.0 and MDCB v2.5.X for proper functionality. Older versions of Tyk Gateway may experience compatibility issues with Tyk OAS API definitions from v5.3.0.
- **After upgrade (the good news)**
  - If you had a Tyk OAS API prior to v5.3.0 then Tyk Dashboard will automatically update the API definition to [latest format]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc" >}}).
  - This means that you do not have to do anything to make your Tyk OAS APIs compatible with the new 5.3.0 release as Tyk Dashboard will take care of that during start-up.
  - As mentioned above, this upgrade of Tyk OAS API definitions is irreversible.
  
**Important:** Please go to the [backup]({{< ref "#upgrade-instructions" >}}) section for essential instructions on how to backup before upgrading to v5.3.0

We are excited to announce the release of 5.3.0, packed with new features, improvements and bug fixes to enhance your experience with Tyk Dashboard. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog](#Changelog-v5.3.0) below.

#### Tyk OAS Feature Maturity

Tyk OAS is now out of [Early Access]({{< ref "frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features" >}}) as we have reached feature maturity. You are now able to make use of the majority of Tyk's features from your Tyk OAS APIs, so they are a credible alternative to the legacy Tyk Classic APIs.
From Tyk 5.3.0 we support the following features when using Tyk OAS APIs with Tyk Dashboard:
- Security
    - All Tyk-supported client-gateway authentication methods including custom auth plugins
    - Automatic configuration of authentication from the OpenAPI description
    - Gateway-upstream mTLS
    - CORS
  
- API-level (global) middleware including:
    - Response caching
    - Custom plugins for PreAuth, Auth, PostAuth, Post and Response hooks
    - API-level rate limits
    - Request transformation - headers
    - Response transformation - headers
    - Service discovery
    - Internal API

- Endpoint-level (per-path) middleware including:
    - Request validation - headers and body (automatically configurable from the OpenAPI description)
    - Request transformation - method, headers and body
    - Response transformation - headers and body
    - URL rewrite and internal endpoints
    - Mock responses (automatically configurable from the OpenAPI description)
    - Response caching
    - Custom Go Post-Plugin
    - Request size limit
    - Virtual endpoint
    - Allow and block listing
    - Do-not-track
    - Circuit breakers

    - Detailed log recording (include payload in the logs)
    - Do-not-track endpoint

- Governance
    - API Versioning
    - API Categories
    - API Ownership

#### API Templates

Exclusively for Tyk OAS APIs, we are pleased to announce the introduction of API Templates: an API governance feature provided to streamline the process of creating APIs. An API template is an asset managed by Tyk Dashboard that is used as the starting point - a blueprint - from which you can create a new Tyk OAS API definition. With templates you can standardise configuration of your APIs more easily, combining your service-specific OpenAPI descriptions with enterprise requirements such as health endpoints, caching and authorisation.

#### Enhanced User Permissions

 Introducing allow list in field-based permissions via the Dashboard specifically tailored for GraphQL APIs. Users can now define granular access control for API key holders based on types and fields from a GraphQL schema. This feature enhances security and flexibility in managing API access, providing a more tailored and secure experience for users.

 #### Global Header Management 

 We've introduced global header management specifically for UDG, simplifying header configuration across all data sources. Users can now effortlessly add, adjust, and delete multiple global headers, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout API management, ultimately saving developers time and effort

#### GraphQL focused analytics
We have made the first step towards bringing our users GraphQL-focused monitoring capabilities. Users can now gain valuable insights into error trends and usage patterns for GraphQL APIs, when storing graph analytics in SQL databases. With the addition of popularity and error bar charts, users can delve deeper into their data, facilitating optimization and troubleshooting efforts.

#### Redis v7.x Compatibility
We have upgraded Redis driver [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) to v9. Subsequently, Tyk 5.3 is compatible with Redis v7.x.

#### MongoDB v7.0.x Compatibility
We have upgraded `mongo-go` driver to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that both Tyk 5.0.x+ and Tyk 5.3 are compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x.

</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Implemented Design Elements for GraphQL Permissions</summary>

Support for field-based permissions allow list has been added in the Dashboard. Users can now define which types and fields from a GraphQL schema an API key holder can access by simply putting a tick next to them in the policy/key definition screens.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Categories support for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

In this update, we've added support for API Categories for Tyk OAS APIs in the Tyk Dashboard, enhancing portfolio management by enabling efficient categorization and organisation of APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Ownership support for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

We’ve extended the API ownership capabilities of Tyk Dashboard to Tyk OAS APIs. This feature allows you to manage visibility of APIs deployed on the Dashboard, streamlining governance processes and enhancing internal security.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Templates for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Extended Tyk Dashboard API to support CRUD operations on API Templates, enabling users to create, apply, and manage templates programmatically.

Added Dashboard UI functionality for creation and management of API Templates, including the ability to create templates from existing Tyk OAS APIs. You can apply templates during API creation, including when importing OpenAPI documents. Access to API templates is controlled through the introduction of a new user permission.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Import OpenAPI Documents from File or URL</summary>

Now you can import the OpenAPI description from a file or URL when creating or updating your Tyk OAS APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Introduced Global Header Management for GraphQL </summary>

Access the new Global Header Management feature directly through the Headers Management tab. Swiftly add and configure multiple global headers or remove them with a single click, ensuring they're forwarded to all GraphQL data sources. This enhancement streamlines header management, providing a more user-friendly experience.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added monitoring capabilities for GraphQL APIs in the Dashboard</summary>

We’ve enabled basic Graph monitoring in the Dashboard. Due to the specificity of GQL APIs, monitoring them as you would REST, is not enough. One endpoint vs multiple endpoints, multiple queries/mutations vs HTTP methods, errors that happen not only in HTTP layer but also come back in response body - that all makes monitoring GQL slightly more complex than just looking at request and error rates.

A new section of the Dashboard offers the following information:
- top 5 most popular graphs and operations requested within them within a specified period of time
- top 5 graphs with errors within a specified period of time
- summary of number of requests, number of successful responses, number of errors, average latency and last access date within a specified period of time for all graphs
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Support MongoDB v7.0.x</summary>

Tyk 5.3 integrates with [storage v1.2.2](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/storage), which updated mongo-go driver we use from v1.11.2 to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that Tyk 5.0.x+ is compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x 
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Support Redis v7.0.x</summary>
 
Tyk 5.3 refactors Redis connection logic by using [storage v1.2.2](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/storage/releases/tag/v1.2.2), which integrates with [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) v9. Subsequently, support now exists for Redis v7.0.x.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

  
#### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced Dashboard Navigation: Introducing Favourite Screens</summary>

Every Dashboard menu item can now be flagged as a favourite so that it is pinned to the top of the menu navigation bar for easier access. We've also made a few changes in styling, so that the navigation menu is nicer to look at.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved UI for GraphQL Data Source Headers Management</summary>

We have moved data source header management to a separate tab, so that it is easy to configure global headers that will be forwarded to all data sources by default. The data source configuration screen displays all headers that will be sent with the upstream request in read-only mode now and changes can be made by switching to Headers Management tab.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Go 1.21 upgrade for Dashboard</summary>

We have updated Tyk Dashboard to use Go 1.21, matching the upgrade in Tyk Gateway 1.21. Remember to recompile any custom Go plugins with the matching version of Go to avoid incompatibility problems.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>The internal TIB session secret defaults to admin_secret if it is not set explicitly</summary>

If internal TIB is enabled in Dashboard and the TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is not set, it will be default to Dashboard admin_secret. It provides better security and user experience because SSO flow would not work if TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET is not set.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Set default MongoDB driver to mongo-go</summary>

Tyk uses `mongo-go` as the default MongoDB driver from v5.3. This provides support for MongoDB 4.4.x, 5.0.x, 6.0.x and 7.0.x. If you are using older MongoDB versions e.g. 3.x, please set MongoDB driver to `mgo`. The [MongoDB supported versions](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb/#supported-versions) page provides details on how to configure MongoDB drivers in Tyk.
</details>
</li>
</ul>
 
#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:

- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved OPA rule restriction on UDG OAS import endpoint</summary>

We fixed an issue where OPA rules were preventing users from importing an OpenAPI document as a UDG data source using the /api/data-graphs/data-sources/import endpoint. The endpoint has now been included into the correct user permission group and will be accessible for users who have `api:write` permissions.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimised Policy Creation Endpoint</summary>

Fixed an issue where applying security policies to large numbers of APIs took a long time. We’ve implemented bulk processing in the validation step at the api/portal/policies/POLICY_ID endpoint, resulting in an 80% reduction in the time taken to apply a policy to 2000 APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Security for Classic Portal</summary>

Moved all HTML inline scripts to their own script files, to accommodate the content security policies that have been enabled, to increase security.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Errors importing larger OpenAPI Documents</summary>

Fixed an issue when importing reasonably large OpenAPI documents via the Dashboard would fail due to MongoDB storage limitation of 16 MB per document.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed SSO flow for Classic Developer Portal</summary>

For Classic Portal cookies and Dashboard, use `SameSite = SameSiteLaxMode` so that SSO flows can be performed
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Remove unnecessary warning output from `tyk-dashboard --version`</summary>
   
Remove the following unnecessary warning output when users use the `tyk-dashboard --version` command to check dashboard version. 
> `WARN toth/tothic: no TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is set. The default cookie store is not available and any calls will fail. Ignore this warning if you are using a different store.`
</details>
</li>  
</ul>
