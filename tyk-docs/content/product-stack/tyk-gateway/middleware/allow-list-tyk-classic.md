The [allow list]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/allow-list-middleware" >}}) is a feature designed to restrict access to only specific API endpoints. It rejects requests to endpoints not specifically "allowed", returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. This enhances the security of the API by preventing unauthorised access to endpoints that are not explicitly permitted.

When working with Tyk Classic APIs the middleware is configured in the Tyk Classic API Definition. You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the newer Tyk OAS APIs, then check out the [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/allow-list-tyk-oas" >}}) page.

## Configuring the allow list in the Tyk Classic API Definition

To enable and configure the allow list you must add a new `white_list` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Historically, Tyk followed the out-dated whitelist/blacklist naming convention. We are working to remove this terminology from the product and documentation, however this configuration object currently retains the old name.
{{< /note >}}

The `white_list` object has the following configuration:
- `path`: the endpoint path
- `method`: this should be blank
- `ignore_case`: if set to `true` then the path matching will be case insensitive
- `method_actions`: a shared object used to configure the [mock response]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/endpoint-designer#mock-response" >}}) middleware

The `method_actions` object should be configured as follows, with an entry created for each allowed method on the path:
- `action`: this should be set to `no_action`
- `code`: this should be set to `200`
- `headers` : this should be blank

For example:
```.json  {linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "extended_paths": {
        "white_list": [
            {
                "disabled": false,
                "path": "/status/200",
                "method": "",
                "ignore_case": false,
                "method_actions": {
                    "GET": {
                        "action": "no_action",
                        "code": 200,
                        "headers": {}
                    }
                    "PUT": {
                        "action": "no_action",
                        "code": 200,
                        "headers": {}
                    }            
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example the allow list middleware has been configured for HTTP `GET` and `PUT` requests to the `/status/200` endpoint. Requests to any other endpoints will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`, unless they also have the allow list middleware enabled.
Note that the allow list has been configured to be case sensitive, so calls to `GET /Status/200` will also be rejected.
Note also that the endpoint path has not been terminated with `$`. Requests to, for example, `GET /status/200/foobar` will be allowed as the [regular expression pattern match]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/allow-list-middleware#endpoint-parsing" >}}) will recognise this as `GET /status/200`.

## Configuring the Allow List in the API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the allow list middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint for the path and select the plugin

From the **Endpoint Designer**, add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to allow access. Select the **Whitelist** plugin.

#### Step 2: Configure the allow list

Once you have selected the middleware for the endpoint, the only additional feature that you need to configure is whether to make the middleware case insensitive by selecting **Ignore Case**.

#### Step 3: Save the API

Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and activate the allow list middleware.
